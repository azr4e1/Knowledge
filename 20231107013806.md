# Subtypes

The subtype relationship arises from the question: if `first_var` has type `first_type`, and `second_var` has type `second_type`, is it safe to assign `first_var = second_var`?

A criterion is the following:
- every value from `second_type` is also in the set of values of `first_type`;
- every function from `first_type` is also in the set of functions of `second_type`

This relation is thus called a subtype relation: `first_type` is a subtype of `second_type`
