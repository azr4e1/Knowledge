# Audiences in GA
Audiences let you segment users in ways that are important to your business. Segment by dimensions, metrics, and events to include nearly any subset of users.

Use audiences in a number of ways:
- Reporting in Analytics: Filter analytics reports by audiences you create
- If using Google Ads, export audiences to use for ad targeting and bidding.
- Trigger events when users match the definition of an audience and become members. Mark those events as conversions and use them for things like bidding in Google Ads.
