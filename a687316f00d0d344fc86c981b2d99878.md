# HTTP methods
HTTP defines a set of request methods to indicate the desired action to be performed for a given resource. They are also referred to as _nouns_. A request method can be _safe_, _idempotent_, or _cacheable_.

- GET: this method request a representation of the specified resource. Requests using GET should only retrieve data.
- HEAD: this method asks for a response identical to a GET request, but without the response body
- POST: this method submits an entity to the specified resource, often causing a change in state or side effects on the server
- PUT: this method replaces all current representations of the target resources with the request payload
- DELETE: this method deletes the specified resource
- CONNECT: this method establishes a tunnel to the server identified by the target resource
- OPTIONS: this method describes the communication options for the target resource
- TRACE: this method performs a message loop-back test along the path to the target resource
- PATCH: this method applies partial modifications to a resource.
