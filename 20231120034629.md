# Parametric vs Non-parametric Analyses
## Parametric
Parametric analyses assume a distribution of data concerning the population under study. These require the same assumptions as [[anova-assumptions]]:
- independence
- normality
- homoscedasticity

## Non-parametric
Non-parametric analyses don't make these underlying distributions assumptions. They convert the data into ranks and analysing these ranks in various ways.


Using parametric analyes we gain _power_, but we need to comply to assumption. Non-parametric don't require these assumptions, but are less powerful.
