# Difference between Bugs and Errors

An error or exception is raised when something bad happens, but as long as our code handles it as users expect it to, it's not a bug. A bug is when code behaves in ways our users don't expect it to.

## Bugs

- Unexpected: crashing
- they need to be fixed

## Error

- Expected and handled: e.g. internet connection lost
- if an error happens and is not handled, then it IS a bug; the bug is that the
  error is not being handled.
