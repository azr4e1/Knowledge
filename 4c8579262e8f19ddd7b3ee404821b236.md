# Analyzing a factorial ANOVA

Always remember to first test for significance of the presentation order for your within-subjects factors.

If it is significant, it means you need to revisit your counterbalancing method.

Only if it is not significant you may proceed to test for the actual factor.

Always remember to test for sphericity when using within-subjects factors.

If the Mauchly test for sphericity is significant, that means your factor violates the sphericity
assumption, and you need to apply the Greenhouse-Geyser correction
