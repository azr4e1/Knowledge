# Unix Domain Sockets in Golang

A socket is a communication endpoint that allows a program to send and receive data over a network.

There are two main types of sockets in Golang: Unix Domain Sockets (`AF_UNIX`) and network sockets (`AF_INET|AF_INET6`).

UDA, or local sockets, are used for communication between processes on the same machine. They use a file-based intereface and can be accessed using the file system path, just like regular files. The data is transmitted between processes using the file system as the communication channel.

The processes communicate by reading and writing to the same socket file, which is managed by the kernel. The kernel is responsible for handling the communication details, such as synchronization, buffering and error handling, and ensures that the data is delivered reliably and in the correct order.
