# Hash Map Data Structure

A hash map or hash table is a structure that maps keys to values. A hash table uses a hash function to compute an index into an array of buckets, from which the desired value can be found. During lookup, the key is hashed and the resulting hash indicates where the corresponding value is stored. A key must be hashable in order to be a key in a hashmap.

Ideally the hash function will assign each key to a unique bucket, but most hash table designs employ an imperfect hash function, which might cause hash collisions where the hash function generates the same index for more than one key. Such collisions are typically accommodated for somehow.o

In a well-built hash map, the average computational cost for each lookup, insertion, and deletion is independent of the number of elements stored in the table. In other words, all these basic operations are O(1).
