# Go Arrays
The type `[n]T` is an array of `n` values of type `T`.

The expression

```go
var a [10]int
```

declares a variable `a` as an array of ten integers.

An array's length is part of its type, so arrays cannot be resized.

An array literal is declared as:
```go
names := [4]string{"John", "Paul", "George", "Ringo"}
```
