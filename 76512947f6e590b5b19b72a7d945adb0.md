# Homelab setup
This is a guide to setup your own home server.

## OS installation
We will be using Fedora Server for this homelab. Download the ISO from https://fedoraproject.org/en/server/download.

Next -> [[fedora-server-setup]]

## Adguard Installation
Adguard Home is a network-wide software for blocking ads and tracking. After you set it, it'll cover
ALL your home devices, without needing any client-side software for that.

It operates as a DNS server that re-routes tracking domains to a "black-hole", thus prventing
your devices from connecting to those servers.

We will be using Docker for that

Next -> [[adguardhome-setup]]
