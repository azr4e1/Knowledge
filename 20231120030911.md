# Running an A/B test
Considerations when running an experiment like in [[designing-for-experimental-control]]:

1. for lengthy experiments, we need to give breaks to the subjects and control the lengths
2. keep people in a lab setting
3. set a time limit?
4. what to record if a student didn't finish the task?
5. too many dropouts?

Experiments are not just about recording numbers. We need to observe the data qualitatively and make conclusions from that.

## Example
Going back to the experiment in [[designing-for-experimental-control]], the formal setup is as follows:

- 40 students
- 2 classes of 20 each
- response: time (mins) -> numeric/continuous/scalar variable
- 1 factor: IDE (Integrated Development Environment)
- 2 levels: Visual Studio (C#), Eclipse (Java)
- this is a between-subject factor.
