# Sensitivity Analysis

Sensitivity analysis is the study of how the uncertainty in the output of a mathematical model or system (numerical or otherwise) can be divided and allocated to different sources of uncertainty in its inputs. This involves estimating sensitivity indices that quantify the influence of an input or group of inputs on the output.

A mathematical model can be highly complex, and as a result, its relationships between inputs and outputs may be faultily understood. In such cases, the model can be viewed as a black box, i.e. the output is an "opaque" function of its inputs.

In models involving many input variables, sensitivity analysis is an essential ingredient of model building and quality assurance and can be useful to determine the impact of a uncertain variable for a range of purposes, including:

- Testing the robustness of the results of a model or system in the presence of uncertainty.
- Increased understanding of the relationships between input and output variables in a system or model.
- Uncertainty reduction, through the identification of model input that cause significant uncertainty in the output and should therefore be the focus of attention in order to increase robustness.
- Searching for errors in the model (by encountering unexpected relationships between inputs and outputs).
- Model simplification â€“ fixing model input that has no effect on the output, or identifying and removing redundant parts of the model structure.
- Enhancing communication from modelers to decision makers (e.g. by making recommendations more credible, understandable, compelling or persuasive).
- Finding regions in the space of input factors for which the model output is either maximum or minimum or meets some optimum criterion (see optimization and Monte Carlo filtering).
- For calibration of models with large number of parameters, by focusing on the sensitive parameters.
- To identify important connections between observations, model inputs, and predictions or forecasts, leading to the development of better models.

## Mathematical Formulation

The object of study for sensitivity analysis is a function $f$ (the model), viewed as a black box, with p-dimensional input vector $X=(X_1, ..., X_p)$ and output $Y = f(X)$.

The variability in input parameters $X_i$ have an impact on the output Y. Sensitivity analysis aims to measure and quantify the impact of each input $X_i$ or a group of inputs on the variability of the output $Y$

## Algorithm

The general process for sensitivity analysis is as follows:

- for the model given by: $Y = f(X), X=(X_1, ..., X_p)$, where
  - $Y$ is the model output
  - $X$ is the model input matrix
  - $X_i$ is the ith value of the input
- Choose a set of values for each $X_i$
- Take the cartesian product of these values as $(X_1, ..., X_m)$
- For each $X_i$, calculate $Y_i = f(X_i)$
- Store the values of $X_i$ mapped to $Y_i$
- Visualize $Y_i$ vs $X_i$.
