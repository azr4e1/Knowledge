# Anatomy of a HTTP message
HTTP messages, as defined in HTTP/1.1 and earlier, are human-readable. In HTTP/2, these messages are embedded into a binary structure, a frame, allowing optimizations like compression of headers and multiplexing.

There are two types of HTTP messages, requests and responses, each with its own format.

## Requests

```curl
GET / HTTP/1.1
Host: developer.mozilla.org
Accept-Language: fr
```

It consists of:

1. HTTP method, a verb like GET, POST etc [[http-methods]] that defines the operation the client wants to perform.
2. The path of the resource to fetch; the URL of the resource stripped from elements that are obvious from context
3. The version of the HTTP protocol
4. Optional headers that convey additional information to the servers
5. A body for some methods like POST, similar to those in responses

## Responses

```curl
```
