# Go Switch cases
Switch cases is a conditional statement that let's us specify any number of _cases_ (possible conditions), linking each case to a different code path.

```go
switch {
  case x < 0:
    fmt.Println("negative")
  case x > 0:
    fmt.Println("positive")
  default:
    fmt.Println("zero")
}
```

We begin with the keyword switch, followed by an opening curly brace, and then a list of cases, and a final closing curly brace.

Each case is introduced by the keyword case, followed by some conditional expression (for example, x < 0) and a colon.

When Go encounters a switch statement like this, it looks at the first case and evaluates the conditional expression there. If this expression is true, the statements for this case are executed, and thatâ€™s the end of the switch statement; control moves on to the next part of the program.

If the expression is false, execution moves on to the next case, and so on, until it finds a case that matches (that is, whose conditional expression evaluates to true). If no case matches, then nothing happens and the program moves on.
