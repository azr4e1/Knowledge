# Just-in-Time JIT
JIT, or “Just in Time” is a compilation design that implies that compilation happens on demand when the code is run the first time. It’s a very broad term that could mean many things.

What people tend to mean when they say a JIT compiler, is a compiler that emits machine code. This is in contrast to an AOT (Ahead of Time) compiler, like the GNU C compiler, GCC or the Rust compiler rustc which generates the machine code once and distributes as a binary executable.
