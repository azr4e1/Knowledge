# Network Sockets
A network socket is a software structure within a network node of a computer network that serves as an endpoint for sending and receiving data across the network.

The API for the network protocol stack creates a `handle` for each socket created by an application, known as `socket descriptor`. In Unix, this descriptor is a type of [[file-descriptors]]. It is stored by the process for use with every read and write operation on the communication channel.

At the time of creation with the API, a network socket is bound to the combination of a type of network protocol to be used, a network address of the host, and port number.

An application can communicate with a remote process by exchanging data with TCP/IP by knowing the combination of protocol type, IP address and port number. This combination is often known as a `socket address`. The remote process establishes a network socket in its own instance of the protocol stack and uses the networking API to connect to the application, presenting its own socket address for use by the application.
