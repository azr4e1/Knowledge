# Init and Post statements in For loops in Go
We usually want to initialise some variable to its starting value, then execute some code as long as its value meets some condition, and then update the value in some way (for example, incrementing it).

We can add an initialising statement before the condition (known as an _init_ statement), and an updating statement, that follows the condition, and executes after the loop body (known as a _post_ statement).

The init statement, condition, and post statement are separated by semicolons.

```go
for x:= 0; x < 10; x++ {
  fmt.Println(x)
}
```
