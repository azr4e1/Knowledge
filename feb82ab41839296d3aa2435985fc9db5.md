# Init and Post statements in For loops in Go
Go has only one looping construct, the for loop.

The basic for loop has three components separated by semicolons:

the _init statement_: executed before the first iteration
the _condition expression_: evaluated before every iteration
the _post statement_: executed at the end of every iteration

The init statement will often be a short variable declaration, and the variables declared there are visible only in the scope of the for statement.

The loop will stop iterating once the boolean condition evaluates to false.


```go
for x:= 0; x < 10; x++ {
  fmt.Println(x)
}
```

The init and post statement are optional
```go
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
	sum := 1
	for sum < 1000 {
		sum += sum
	}
	fmt.Println(sum)
}
```
