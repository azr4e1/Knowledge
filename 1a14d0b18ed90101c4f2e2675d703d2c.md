# Generic Types in Go
In addition to generic functions, Go also supports generic types. A type can be parametrized with a type parameter, which could be useful for implementing generic data structures.

```go
package main

// List represents a singly-linked list that holds
// values of any type
type List[T any] struct {
  val T
  next *List[T]
}
```
