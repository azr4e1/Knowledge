# Cryptographic agility

The more options a system has for picking the cryptography it uses, the greater the opportunity for making a cryptographic mistake. For this reason, we’ll avoid doing this here. Typically, we’ll prefer NaCl cryptography, which has a simple interface without any options, and it is efficient and secure. When designing a system, it helps to make a well-informed opinionated choice of the cryptography used. The property of cryptographic agility, or being able to switch the cryptography out, may be useful in recovering from a suspected failure. However, it may be prudent to step back and consider why the failure happened and incorporate that into future revisions.
