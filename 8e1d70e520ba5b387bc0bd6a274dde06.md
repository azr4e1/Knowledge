# GA and data
## Website
To connect a website to GA, you need to add a tag to the site.

A __tag__ is a small piece of code added to each page of your website in order to measure users.

A tag can be added directly to the code, or you can use a tag management system like __Google Tag Manager__

Once a tag has been added, it will collect information on the user like device type and geographical information,
and how they interact with your website.

This interactions are sent to GA as _events_. E.g. First visit of a user will be logged as _first visit event_.

Events provide insight into what's happening on your website or app, such as page views, button clicks, user actions, or system events.

By collecting data as events, Analytics combines app and web data in a common language in your reports.

As events are collected, they are processed and turned into information you can see in reports.

You can also create custom events for specific actions you want to analyse.


## Mobile app
To connect GA to an app, you need to add the _Firebase SDK_ to the app.
