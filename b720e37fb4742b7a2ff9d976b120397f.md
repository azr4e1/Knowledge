# Terminal control flow
Pressing ctrl_s on the terminal will cause it to look like it's frozen. To unlock it, press ctrl_q.

  ctrl_s sends a `XOFF` signal. This is part of Software flow control. XOFF notifies the process or device sending data that the input buffer is full and it shouldn't send any more data.
