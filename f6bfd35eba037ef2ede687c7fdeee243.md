# Graph Data Structure

A graph is an abstract data type that represents a set of vertices and the edges that connect those vertices.

When an algorithm traverses a graph, it typically moves across the edges. For example, the traveling salesman problem [[non-deterministic-polynomial-time]] is best represented using a graph data structure.
