# Named result parameters in Go
Besides giving name to parameters of a function, we can assign names to the results of a function, in its signature.

One reason to do so is documentation.

A side-effect of doing this is that the parameters are automatically _declared_ ([[declaration-in-go]]) inside the function, so they can be assigned ([[assignment-statement-in-go]]).

Go allow us to omit the names from the return statments in the case all the named result values are assigned; in this case, the values of these names would be implicitly returned. These style is called _naked returns_.

This is generally considered bad practice because it makes it more difficult to follow the logic flow.
