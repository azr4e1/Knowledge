# quicksort algorithm

Quick sort is an efficient sorting algorithm that's widely used in production sorting implementations. Like merge sort, quick sort is a divide and conquer algorithm.

## Divide

- Select a pivot element that will preferably end up close to the center of the sorted pack
- Move everything onto the "greater than" or "less than" side of the pivot
- The pivot is now in its final position
- Recursively repeat the operation on both sides of the pivot

## Conquer

- The array is sorted after all elements have been through the pivot operation


## Pseudocode

The process is started with quick_sort(A, 0, len(A)-1)

### quick_sort(nums, low, high)

If low is less than high:

1. Partition the input list using the partition function
2. Recursively call quick_sort on the left side of the partition
3. Recursively call quick_sort on the right side of the partition

### partition(nums, low, high)

1. Set pivot to the element at index high
2. Set i to low
3. For each index (j) from low to high
      1. If the element at index j is less than the pivot:
          1. Swap the element at index i with the element at index j
          2. Increment i by 1
4. Swap the element at index i with the element at index high
5. Return the index i
