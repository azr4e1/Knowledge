# insertion sort algorithm

Insertion sort builds a final sorted list one item at a time. It's much less efficient on large lists than more advanced algorithms like quicksort or merge sort.

## Pseudocode

- For each index in the input list:
  - Set a j variable to the current index
  - While j is greater than 0 and the element at index j-1 is greater than the element at index j:
	  - Swap the elements at indices j and j-1
	  - Decrement j by 1
- Return the list
