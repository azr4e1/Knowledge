# Goroutines
A goroutine is a lightweight thread managed by the Go runtime

```go
go f(x, y, z)
```

starts a new goroutine running
```go
f(x, y, z)
```

The evaluation of `f`, `x`, `y`, and `z` happens in the current goroutine and the execution of `f` happens in the new goroutine

Goroutines run in the same address space, so access to shared memory must by synchronized. The `sync` package provides useful primitives, although you won't need them much in Go as there are other primitives.

```go
package main

import (
  "fmt"
  "time"
)

func say(s string) {
  for i := 0; i < 5; i++ {
    time.Sleep(100 * time.Millisecond)
    fmt.Println(s)
  }
}

func main() {
  go say("world")
  say("hello")
}
```
