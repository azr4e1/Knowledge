# Adjacency List for Graphs

An adjacency list is a list of lists used to represent a finite graph.

An adjacency list stores a list of vertices for each vertex that indicates where the connections are:

0 connects with 1, 4
1 connects with 0, 2, 3, 4
2 connects with 1, 3
3 connects with 1, 2, 4
4 connects with 0, 1, 3
