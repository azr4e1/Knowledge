# Test the ANOVA assumptions
## Independence
This is just guaranteed by sound experiment design
## Normality
To test the ANOVA assumption of normality, we can use the _shapiro-wilks_ test on the _residuals_. A significant results indicates departures from normality.

```R
# Shapiro-Wilk normality test on response
shapiro.test(ide2[ide2$IDE == "VStudio",]$Time)
shapiro.test(ide2[ide2$IDE == "Eclipse",]$Time)

#         Shapiro-Wilk normality test
#
# data:  ide2[ide2$IDE == "VStudio", ]$Time
# W = 0.84372, p-value = 0.004191

# but really what matters most is the residuals
m = aov(Time ~ IDE, data=ide2) # fit model (linear regression)
shapiro.test(residuals(m)) # test residuals
qqnorm(residuals(m)); qqline(residuals(m)) # plot residuals
```

`qqnorm` creates a Q-Q plot (quantile of normal distribution VS quantile of data)

## Homoscedasticity
We can use Levene's test for homogeneity of variance. Again, here stat. sig. mean violation of homoscedasticity.

Brown-Forsythe test does the same as Levene's but uses the median instead of the mean and is considered more robust.


When homoscedasticity is violated, we can run a Welch t-test, which doesn't require this assumption. However normality of residuals is still required:
```R
t.test(Time ~ IDE, data=ide2, var.equal=FALSE) # Welch t-test
```
