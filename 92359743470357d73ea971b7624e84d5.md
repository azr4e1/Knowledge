# Generalized Linear Models
A few facts about GLM:
- Nominal logistic regression is also called multinomial logistic regression. This has a multinomial distribution with logit link function
- Ordinal Logistic regression for Likert responses has a multinomial distribution with cumulative logit link function
- Poisson regression for count responses uses a Poisson distribution with Log link function.
