# Go slices length and capacity
A slice has both a _length_ and a _capacity_.

The _length_ of a slice is the number of elements it contains.

The _capacity_ of a slice is the number of elements in the _underlying array_, counting from the _first_ element in the slice.

The length and capacity of a slice `s` can be obtained using the expressions `len(s)` and `cap(s)`

You can extend a slice's length by re-slicing it, provided it has sufficient capacity.
