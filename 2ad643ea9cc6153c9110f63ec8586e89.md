# The Big Tech enshittification process
Enshittification is a three stage process:

1. Surpluses are allocated to users until they are locked in
2. Surpluses are then withdrawn from users and given to business-customers until they are locked in.
3. All value is then harvested for the company's shareholders, leaving just enough residual value in the service to keep both end-users and business-customers glued to the platform.
