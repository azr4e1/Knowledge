# Pointer methods in Go
A pointer type can also have methods. These are defined like normal methods, but taking care that the receiver ([[go-types-and-methods]]) is a pointer and thus needs to be dereferenced.

E.g.:
```go
type MyInt int

func (input *MyInt) Double() {
  *input *= 2
}
```

N.B.: while functions with a pointer argument must take a pointer, methods with pointer receivers take either a value or a pointer as the receiver when they are called. When they are passed the value, the method with the pointer receiver is called automatically.
```go
x = MyInt(3)
// you can do this:
(&x).Double()
// you can also do this:
x.Double()
```

In the example above, when you pass `x` by value, Go will interpret the statement as `(&x).Double()` as a convenience.
