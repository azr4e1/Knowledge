# One behaviour, one test
Programming tests should be simple.

When what we want to test has multiple behaviours depending on the input, we should follow the following principle:

__One behaviour, one test__.

Multiple test cases for a single behavior in order to test a single behaviour. To test another behaviour, create a separate test.
