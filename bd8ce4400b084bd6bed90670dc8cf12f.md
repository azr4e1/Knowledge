# Mann-Whitney test
If we want to use the underlying ranks in our data and not be limited by the anova assumption ([[anova-assumptions]]), we can use the Mann-Whitney test.
```R
library(coin)
wilcox_test(Time ~ IDE, data=ide2, distribution="exact")

#         Exact Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney Test
#
# data:  Time by IDE (Eclipse, VStudio)
# Z = 2.9487, p-value = 0.002577
# alternative hypothesis: true mu is not equal to 0
```

N.B.: Taking the log of time in the example of [[designing-for-experimental-control]] won't change the result of a non-parametric test, because taking the log of the response doesn't change the inherent ranks in the data.
