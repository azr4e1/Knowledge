# Struct in Go
A `struct` in Go is a structured data type: something that contains multiple different bits of information, united into a single record.

A `struct` is a colection of fields.

```go
package main

import "fmt"

type Vertex struct {
	X int
	Y int
}

func main() {
	fmt.Println(Vertex{1, 2})
}
```
