# Exerting control
How can we make sure we have experimental control in a study?

If something in a study threatens to change the results, we can
1. __manipulate it__: treating it as a factor and making it a variable.
2. __control for it__: we cannot treat is as a variable, but maybe we can control it so that we this confounding variables is the same for all.
3. __Record/measure it__: at least we can evaluate in some ways if it had an impact and in what measure.
4. __Hidden effect__: maybe we aren't even aware of its presence.
