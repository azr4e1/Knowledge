# Pointers to struct
Struct fields can be accessed through a struct pointer.

To access the field `X` of a struct when we have the struct pointer `p` we could write `(*p).X`. However, that notation is cumbersome, so the language permits us instead to write just `p.X`, without the explicit dereference.

That is called `automatic dereference` [[pointer-methods-in-go]]
