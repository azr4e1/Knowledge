# Unix Domain Sockets
A Unix Domain socket (UDS) or IPC socket (inter-process communication) is a data communication endpoint for exchanging data between processes executing on the same host operating system. It is also referred by its address family `AF_UNIX`

Differently from TCP/IP sockets, a UDP operates on a single machine. Listening sockets live in the filesystem hierarchy and access to them can be controlled by filesystem permission.

A process accepting connections on a Unix socket can determine the user ID of the process that connects.
