# Git stage and commit

`git add <file|pattern>` will add your files to the _index_
or staging area. They will be tracked as staged.

## Committing

Once the files you want to save have been added to the
index, you can commit them to the git directory with

`git commit -m "message"`

To modify the message of the latest commit, do `git commit --amend -m "new message"`
