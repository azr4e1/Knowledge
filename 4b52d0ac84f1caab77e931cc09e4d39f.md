# merge sort algorithm

Merge sort is a recursive sorting algorithm and it's quite a bit faster than bubble sort.

Merge sort is a divide and conquer algorithm.:

1. Divide: divide the large problem into smaller problems, and recursively solve the smaller problems
2. Conquer: Combine the results of the smaller problems to solve the large problem

In merge sort specifically we:

Divide:
1. Divide the array into two (equal) halves
2. Recursively sort the two halves

Conquer:
1. Merge the two halves to form a sorted array
