# Defining constants in Go
We define a constant with the `const` keyword:

```go
const CategoryAutobiography = "Autobiography"
```

We can group multiple constants between brackets:

```go
const (
    CategoryAutobiography = "Autobiography"
    CategoryLargePrintRomance = "Large Print Romance"
    CategoryParticlePhysics = "Particle Physics"
)
```

When the set of constants need to be of a certain type, we can specify the type for the first constant, and the rest will infer it automatically:
```go
type Category int

const (

    CategoryAutobiography Category = 0
    CategoryLargePrintRomance = 1
    CategoryParticlePhysics = 2
)
```
