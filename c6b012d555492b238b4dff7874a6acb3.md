# Compilation in Go
Go uses a program called _compiler_, which reads Go source code and translates it into machine code.

In order for Go code to produce an executable, there has to be some code ina special package called `main`.

Since you can't have more than one package in the same folder (except for test packages), you need to put `main` package in a subfolder of the project. Because the `main` package produces a command (the executable), it's conventional to name this folder `cmd`.

The `main` package also needs to contain the `main` function, which is where the program will start.
