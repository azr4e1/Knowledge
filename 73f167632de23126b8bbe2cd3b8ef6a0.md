# Understand Google Analytics Reports
You can find all of your reports by clicking the reports icon in the left-hand
navigation. By default, you'll see a report snapshot as well as the realtime
report. Below these are two default report collections: lifecycle, which
contains reports about acquisition, onsite behavior, and monetization; and
user, which contains reports on technology and demographic information.


Google Analytics has two main types of reports: an overview report, which summarizes information about a topic into several cards, each focusing on a different objective, and a details report that lets you drill into one or two dimensions to investigate data in greater detail in a table format.

## Acquisition
The first report in acquisition is an acquisition overview report, and the other reports focus on insights around user and traffic acquisition.

On the overview report, you'll see cards that provide a snapshot of your acquisition data. Each of the cards have icons at the top. The first is a data quality icon, which indicates how much data is being represented in the card.

If a filter has been applied to a card, a filter icon will also appear.

At the bottom of each card are options to dig deeper into that specific insight or dataset.

The user acquisition report shows where users come from when they reach your website or app. This offers insight into how new users find your website or app for the very first time, because it uses the very first campaign, medium, and source observed for the user.
- Campaign is the name of the referring Google Ads campaign or a custom campaign that you've created.
- Medium refers to the origin of the traffic. For example, CPC, which stands for cost per click, and means paid search.
- Source refers to the origin of the traffic. For example, Google, and gives more clarity to the medium.


In the traffic acquisition report, each dimension includes session.

A session is a way to group user interactions based on when a user engaged with your website or your app.

For example, a session begins when a user opens their browser and navigates to your website. That session would end when the user closes the browser tab to your website.

The traffic acquisition report focuses on where new sessions come from, regardless of whether the user is new or returning.

 By default, most Google Analytics reports will show data for the last 28 days when you first open the report, but you can adjust the date range above the report to one of many preset date ranges or a custom date range that you choose.


To customize the report collections shown, you need the Editor role on the
property. Once in Reports, at the bottom of the navigation panel, select
Library. From there, add pre-created collections or create a new collection.
Each property can have up to seven collections.
