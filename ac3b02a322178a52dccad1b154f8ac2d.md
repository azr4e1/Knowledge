# Go maps
A `map` is a data structure that allows to store values with arbitrary indexes called _keys_.

A map literal in go is defined like this:
```go
catalog := map[int]Book{
  1: {ID: 1, Title: "For the Love of Go"}
}
```

so you specify the type of the key inside square brackets, and the type of the values afterwards.

To access elements, you just need to specify their key in square brackets:
```go
catalog[1]
```
