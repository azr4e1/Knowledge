# Composite values and structs in Go
A data type made up of several values that you can treat as a single unit is called a _composite type_.

A `struct` in Go groups together related pieces of data, called _fields_.

E.g.:
```go
// Customer represents information about a customer.
type Customer struct {
  Name string
  Email string
}
```
