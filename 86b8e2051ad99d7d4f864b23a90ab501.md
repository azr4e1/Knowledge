# Use a map to represent a set in Go
When you want to represent a set of objects in Go, a nice trick is to use a map with keys as your objects, and values as booleans.

E.g.:
```go
var myMap = map[Object]bool{
  Object1: true,
  Object2: true,
  Object3: true,
  ...,
}
```

This will make it very natural when checking the existence of an object in your set:
```go
if myMap[obj] {
  ...
}
```

in fact, if the object doesn't exist, by default Go returns the empty value ([[non-existent-keys-in-go-maps]]), which for booleans is `false`.
