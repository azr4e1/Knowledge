# Go slices
An array has a fixed size. A _slice_, on the other hand, is a dynamically-sized, flexible _view_ into the elements of an array.

The type `[]T` is a slice with elements of type `T`

It is a kind of Go type that represents an _ordered_ collection of elements, all of the same type.

A slice literal specifies the name of the slice type, followed by some element in curly braces:
```go
[]string{'a', 'b', 'c',}
```

In a slice literal of some custom type, such as a struct, we donâ€™t need to repeat that type name as part of every element literal: the compiler can infer it.

We use the square-bracket notation to refer to a particular numbered element of the slice:
```go
mySlice[0]
```

is the first element of the slice `mySlice`. Index starts from 0.

`len` is a built-in function that returns the length of a slice. `append` is a function that appends elements to a slice.

A slice is formed by specifying two indices, a low and high bound, separated by a colon:
```go
var a [10]int

a[low:high]
```

This selects a half-open range which includes the first element, but excludes the last one.
