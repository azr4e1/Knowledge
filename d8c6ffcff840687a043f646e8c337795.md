# Go slices
A slice in Go is what is referred to as _array_ in other languages: a sequence of values of the same type.

It is a kind of Go type that represents an _ordered_ collection of elements, all of the same type.

A slice literal specifies the name of the slice type, followed by some element in curly braces:
```go
[]string{'a', 'b', 'c',}
```

In a slice literal of some custom type, such as a struct, we donâ€™t need to repeat that type name as part of every element literal: the compiler can infer it.

We use the square-bracket notation to refer to a particular numbered element of the slice:
```go
mySlice[0]
```

is the first element of the slice `mySlice`. Index starts from 0.

`len` is a built-in function that returns the length of a slice. `append` is a function that appends elements to a slice.
