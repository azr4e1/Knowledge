# Anova assumptions
With certain analysis of variance ([[independent-samples-t-test]]) there are some assumptions.

ANOVA stands for Analysis of Variance.

The three ANOVA assumptions are:
1. __Independence__: each subject is sampled independently of every other subject. ([[snowball-sampling]] violates this.) This means that measures of a subject are independent from measures of another subject. However, in a within-subject study ([[example-analysis-of-an-ab-test]]), measures of a subject on a level are not independent from measure of the same subject on another level. (Verified through experiment design)
2. __Normality__: the data is normally distributed.
3. __Homoscedasticity__: the variance among groups being compared is similar.
