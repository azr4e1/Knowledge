# Writing Struct literals in Go
A struct literal begins with the name of the type, followed by curly braces. Then we write inside the curly braces a list of pairs of field names and values separated by colons. Each field, including the last one, must be followed by a comma.

E.g.
```go
Customer{
  Name: "John Arundel",
  Email: "john.arundel@gmail.com",
}
```
