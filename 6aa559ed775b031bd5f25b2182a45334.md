# cgroups
A control group (cgroup) is a Linux kernel feature that limits, accounts for, and isolates the resource usage (CPU, memory, disk I/O, network, and so on) of a collection of processes. They provide the following features:

- resource limits
- prioritazation
- accounting/monitoring
- control

By default, the operating system terminates a process when it exceeds a resource limit defined by its cgroup.
