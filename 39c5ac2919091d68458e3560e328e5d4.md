# Git repos

The very first step of any project is to create a
repository. A Git "repository" (or "repo") represents a
single project.

A repo is essentially just a directory that contains a
project (other directories and files). The only difference
is that it also contains a hidden .git directory. That
hidden directory is where Git stores all of its internal
tracking and versioning information for the project.

To initialize a git repo, use

```bash
git init
```
