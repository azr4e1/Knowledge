# Assignment statement in Go
The following statement:
```go
b = Book{Title: "The Making of a Butterfly"}
```
is an _assignment statement_: it assigns a literal value of the Book struct to a variable named b, which must already exist.

We can think of this as assigning labels to values; from now own, we can refer to that `Book` value via the name b, and everytime the name b occurs in the code, it will be translated to that `Book` value.

## Short Variable Declaration
It’s so common in Go to want to declare a variable and then assign a value to it that there’s actually a special syntax form to do just this: the short variable declaration.

It looks like this:
```go
b := Book{Title: "The Making of a Butterfly"}
```

The type is inferred from the type of the literal.

N.B. Short variable declaration is only allowed inside functions.


This both declares a new variable b, and assigns it a `Book` literal, in a single statement. It is a shorthand for
```go
var b = Book{Title: "The Making of a Butterfly"}
```

or even
```go
var b Book = Book{Title: "The Making of a Butterfly"}
```

The difference between these last two statements is that in the first, the type is inferred from right-hand side, while in the latter the type is specified. This can be useful in cases where you want the type to be different from what would be inferred:
```go
var c float64 = 2
```
