# Quick Python tips and facts

## None object

None is useful as a placeholder. If you know you need to capture a value into a variable, but don't have the value yet, you can create the variable and assign it to `None`. NB: None has type `NoneType`.

When printint, it can be useful to print `type(None)` instead of just none, as the latter would print exactly the same as `"None"`.

## None return

When no return value is specified in a function, it will automatically return None. For example, maybe it's a function that prints some text to the console, but doesn't explicitly return a value.

## main function

The `main()` function is a convention used in many programming languages to specify the entry point of an application. By defining a single `main` function, and only calling `main()` at the end of the entire program we ensure that all of our functions are defined before they're called.

## Scope

Scope refers to where a variable or function name is available to be used. For example, when we create variables in a function (such as by giving names to our parameters), that data is not available outside of that function.

In Python, variables are scoped within their functions. So, for example, defining a variable inside an if block or a for loop block will make the variable available to the function the block is defined in, but not to the outer function/global scope.

## Division of integers

In Python, numbers without a decimal part are called integers.

A float is the number type that allows for decimal values.

When dividing two integers in Python, the result is actually a `float`.

## Scientific notation

You can represent numbers in scientific notation like so: `1024 = 1.024e3`

## Underscore separators

You can make big numbers more legible using underscores: `100000000000000000 = 100_000_000_000_000_000`

## binary conversion

The built-in int function can convert a binary string to an integer. It takes a second argument that specifies the base of the number (binary is base 2). For example:

```python
# this is a binary string
binary_string = "100"

# convert binary string to integer
num = int(binary_string, 2)
```

## Infinity

The built-in `float()` function can create a numeric floating point value of negative infinity. Because every value will be greater than negative infinity, we can use it to help us accomplish our goal of finding the max value.

```python
negative_infinity = float("-inf")
positive_infinity = float("inf")
```

## Dictionaries order

As of Python version 3.7, dictionaries are ordered. In Python 3.6 and earlier, dictionaries were unordered.

Because dictionaries are ordered, the items have a defined order, and that order will not change.

Unordered means that the items do not have a defined order, so you couldn't refer to an item by using an index.

The takeaway is that if you're on Python 3.7 or later, you'll be able to iterate over dictionaries in the same order every time.
