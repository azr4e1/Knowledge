# Quick Python tips and facts

## None object

None is useful as a placeholder. If you know you need to capture a value into a variable, but don't have the value yet, you can create the variable and assign it to `None`. NB: None has type `NoneType`.

When printint, it can be useful to print `type(None)` instead of just none, as the latter would print exactly the same as `"None"`.

## None return

When no return value is specified in a function, it will automatically return None. For example, maybe it's a function that prints some text to the console, but doesn't explicitly return a value.

## main function

The `main()` function is a convention used in many programming languages to specify the entry point of an application. By defining a single `main` function, and only calling `main()` at the end of the entire program we ensure that all of our functions are defined before they're called.

## Scope

Scope refers to where a variable or function name is available to be used. For example, when we create variables in a function (such as by giving names to our parameters), that data is not available outside of that function.

In Python, variables are scoped within their functions. So, for example, defining a variable inside an if block or a for loop block will make the variable available to the function the block is defined in, but not to the outer function/global scope.

## Division of integers

In Python, numbers without a decimal part are called integers.

A float is the number type that allows for decimal values.

When dividing two integers in Python, the result is actually a `float`.

## Scientific notation

You can represent numbers in scientific notation like so: `1024 = 1.024e3`

## Underscore separators

You can make big numbers more legible using underscores: `100000000000000000 = 100_000_000_000_000_000`
