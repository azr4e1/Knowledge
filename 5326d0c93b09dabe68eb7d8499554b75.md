# Type switches in Go
A type switch is a construct that permits to do several type assertions in series.

A type switch is like a regular switch statement [[switch-expressions]], but the cases in a type switch specify types (not values), and those values are compared against the type of the value held by the given interface value:

```go
switch v := i.(type) {
case T:
  // here v has type T
case S:
  // here v has type S
default:
  // no match; here v has the same type as i
}
```

The declaration in a type switch has the same syntax as a type assertion `i.(T)` but the specific type `T` is replaced with the keyword `type`.

This switch statement tests whether the interface value `i` holds a value of type `T` or `S`. In each of the `T` and `S` cases, the variable `v` will be of type `T` or `S` respectively and hold the value held by `i`. In the default case (where there is no match), the variable `v` is of the same interface type and value as `i`.
