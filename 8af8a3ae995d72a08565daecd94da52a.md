# Introduction to Mixed Effects Models
Generalized Linear Mixed Models can also handle within-subject tests.

GLMM is called `mixed` because we are mixing `fixed` and `random` effects.

- Random Effects: factors whose levels were sampled randomly from a large population, but whose specific level values we don't care about. E.g. Subject is a random effect.
- Fixed Effects: factors of interest that we manipulate in a study.

As said, subject is a random effect, which, if included, makes the model a
Mixed linear model. Including them allows us to correlate measures across the
same subjects across different rows in the metatable.

## Advantages
- we can handle missing data points
- better handle unbalanced designs
- no need for sphericity test [[one-way-repeated-measures-anova]]

## Disadvantages
- computationally more intensive
- they retain larger DFres (Denominator degrees of freedom)


A nested effect comes into play when the levels of a factor shouldn't be pooled just by their label alone.
E.g. subjects is nested in the Keyboard factor and Posture factor.
