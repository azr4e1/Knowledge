# Git rebase

Say we have this commit history:

A - B - C    main
   \
    D - E    feature_branch

We're working on feature_branch, and want to bring in the changes our team added to main so we're not working with a stale branch. We could merge main into feature_branch, but that would create an additional merge commit. Rebase avoids a merge commit by replaying the commits from feature_branch on top of main. After a rebase, the history will look like this:

A - B - C         main
         \
          D - E   feature_branch

You generally want to rebase the _feature_ branch to the tip of the base branch, NOT THE OTHER WAY AROUND!. This allows you to merge feature into base with a fast-forward merge, which doesn't clutter commit history with merge commits.

the command to rebase is

```bash
git rebase <branch>
```
