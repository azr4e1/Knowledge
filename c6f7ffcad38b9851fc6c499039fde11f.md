# Git tips and uses

Git is the distributed version control system (VCS). Nearly every developer in the world uses it to manage their code. It has quite a monopoly on VCS. Developers use Git to:

- Keep a history of their code changes
- Revert mistakes made in their code
- Collaborate with other developers
- Make backups of their code
- And much more

## Porcelain and Plumbing

In Git, commands are divided into high-level ("porcelain") commands and low-level ("plumbing") commands.

## Repo

The very first step of any project is to create a repository. A Git "repository" (or "repo") represents a single project.

A repo is essentially just a directory that contains a project (other directories and files). The only difference is that it also contains a hidden .git directory. That hidden directory is where Git stores all of its internal tracking and versioning information for the project.

To initialize a git repo, use

```bash
git init
```
