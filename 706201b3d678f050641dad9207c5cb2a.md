# Go packages
Every Go program is made up of packages.

Programs start running in the `main` package.

The package name is the same as the last element of the import path. E.g.,
the `math/rand` package comprises files that begin with the `package rand`
statement.

Example:
```go
package main

import (
"fmt"
"math/rand"
)

func main() {
fmt.Println("My favorite number is", rand.Intn(10))
}
```
