# Git undoing changes

One of the major benefits of using Git is the ability to undo changes. There
are a lot of different ways to do this.

## Soft Reset

The git reset command can be used to undo the last commit(s) or any changes in
the index (staged but not committed changes) and the worktree (unstaged and not
committed changes).

```bash
git reset --soft HEAD~1
```

The --soft option is useful if you just want to go back to a previous commit,
but keep all of your changes. Committed changes will be uncommitted and staged,
while uncommitted changes will remain staged or unstaged as before. HEAD~1
refers to the commit 1 before the current commit.

## Hard reset

If we don't want to keep the changes, we can do a hard reset:

```bash
git reset --hard COMMITHASH
```
