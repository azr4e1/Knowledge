# What is anarchism

The philosopher Noam Chomsky believes that any authority of any kind, particularly a hierarchical one, has always the crucial job of justifying its own existence.

They have the burden of proof to bear. It has to demonstrate that it's legitimate. Authority is not a self-justifying thing.

Therefore, an anarchist is simply someone that takes the question "Can they justify their position of authority" very seriously.

If the "authority" can prove they legitimacy, it can stay. Otherwise, it must be dismantled. That's anarchism.

An anarchist is someone who insists on knowing how exactly is a certain group of people being in charge or a certain kind of rules being followed serving everyone better than if they didn't exist at all.
