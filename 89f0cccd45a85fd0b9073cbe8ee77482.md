# Fedora Server setup
Create a bootable stick using a spare USB stick. Plug it in, unmount it and run
```bash
dd if=fedora_server_iso_location of=/dev/sdb status=progress
```
where `/dev/sdb` is the device file of the USB stick (not a parition!)

When finished, plug it in the device (laptop in our case) you want to turn into server, and boot that device from that USB stick.

Follow the installation steps and you should have your Fedora Instance running.

Log in as root.

In order to turn off the display after one minute, edit `/etc/default/grub` and add or modify it so that it has
```bash
GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX="consoleblank=60"
```

In order to not put the computer in suspend when closing the lid, modify `/etc/systemd/logind.conf` so that
it contains (not commented):
```bash
HandleLidSwitch=ignore
HandleLidSwitchExternalPower=ignore
HandleLidSwitchDocked=ignore
```
