# Linked List Data Structure

A linked list is a linear data structure where elements are not stored next to each other in memory. The elements in a linked list are linked using pointers.

Linked lists can be contrasted with the native List (aka Array) in Python. Items in a normal list are stored next to each other in memory, and to get an item from a List we need to use the numbered index:

```python
item = my_list[1]
```

In a linked list, there are no indexes. We need to walk each node of the list because the only way to get the location of the second item in a linked list is to look at the pointer of the first item.
