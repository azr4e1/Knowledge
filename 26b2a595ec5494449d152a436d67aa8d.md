# Interaction effects
When dealing with factorial experiments, we can ask two questions:
- is there a main effect?
- what is the interaction?

Going back to the keyboard example ([[factorial-anova]]), is there a main effect on WPM overall when sitting or standing. And is there an interaction between these two? E.g. would posture differentially affect the performance on keyboard?
