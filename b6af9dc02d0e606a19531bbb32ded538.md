# Introduction to Generalized Linear Models
ANOVA fall in the category of _linear models_ (LM).

There is a generalization of linear models called __GLM__ (Generalized Linear Models).

Conceptually, a linear model relates the factors (predictor variables) to a response,
which is considered to be normally distributed in nature.

A GLM allows the response to be related to other forms of distribution like Poisson, Gamma, etc.

When generalizing the model to these other distributions, we are able to analyze data that would
otherwise violate [[anova-assumptions]]

GLM can only handle between-subjects factors.
