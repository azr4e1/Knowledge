# Iota constant in Go
When we are only interested in representing the allowed value of something, but we don't care what those actual values are, we can use the `iota` constant. It will get the value 0, and successive constants will get successively increasing values: 1, 2, 3...

```go
type Category int

const (
    CategoryAutobiography Category = iota
    CategoryLargePrintRomance
    CategoryParticlePhysics
)
```
