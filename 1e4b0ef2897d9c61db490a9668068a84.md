# Values and Variables
A value is a piece of data, like 'Hello, World!'. Values have types: the type of 'Hello, World!' is named `string`. So we call this a _string value_.

A variable is a name identifying a particular place in the computer's memory that can store some specific value. A variable (in Go and other programming languages like C and Haskell) also has a type, which determines what values it can hold.

A string variable can only hold string values, etc.

In Go, we _declare_ a variable and its type with the following syntax
```go
var title string
var copies int
```

The Go compiler will use the type information you've provided to check whether you accidentally assigned a value to the wrong type of variable.
