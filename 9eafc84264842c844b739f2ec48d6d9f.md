# Clean Code

Paradigms like object-oriented programming [[object-oriented-programming]] and functional programming [[functional-programming]] are all about making code easier to work with and understand as the feeble humans we are. Code that's easy for humans to understand is called "clean code".

    Any fool can write code that a computer can understand. Good programmers write code that humans can understand.

    -- Martin Fowler
