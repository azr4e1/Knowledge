# Go tests
Go provides the built-in `testing` package for tests.

Each test in Go is a function, with some special requirements:
- it must be in a file whose name ends in `_test.go`;
- the name of a test function must begin with the word `Test`;
- it has to accept a parameter whose type is `*testing.T`;
- they don't return anything.

When all this requirements are satisfied, you can run the tests from the terminal with: `go test`
