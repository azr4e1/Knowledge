# Stack Overflow
This is a phenomenon that happens when the call stack ([[heap-and-stack]]) of an application exceeds its set limits.

A stack ([[stack-data-structure]]) is a data structure similar to a pile of books. The call stack contains
the functions and methods of the application, and their local variables, in order of call.

The size of the stack depends on many factor, like language, machine, threads and memory.

When a program attempts to use more space than is available on the call stack, the stack is said to
_overflow_, resulting in a crash.
