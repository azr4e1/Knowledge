# Blank identifier in Go
The Go compiler won't let us declare a variable that we never refer to again (it correctly infers that this must be a mistake)

Sometimes however we _need_ a variable syntactically, as in the left-hand side of an assignment statement: in this case, we can use the _blank identifier_ `_` to act as a placeholder.
