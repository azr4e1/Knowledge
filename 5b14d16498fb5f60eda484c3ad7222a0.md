# Sorting a slice in Go
A slice is an _ordered_ collection of elements. A map is a random collection of elements. This means that when we want to compare the elements of a map (not the _keys_) agains a slice, we should make sure that both are sorted to avoid errors due to the fact that map is not ordered.

We can use the `slice.Slice` function, which takes a slice, and a comparison function that explains how any two elements of the slice should be ordered; this functions will order the slice _in place_.
